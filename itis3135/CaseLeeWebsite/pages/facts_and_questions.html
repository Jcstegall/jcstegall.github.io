                <p class="section-intro">Paintless Dent Repair (PDR) is a specialized technique for removing minor dents from a vehicle's body without the need for painting. It's a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional body shop repairs for many types of damage.</p>

                            <summary>What types of dents can be repaired with PDR?</summary>
                            <div class="faq-content">
                                <p>PDR works best on minor to medium-sized dents where the paint hasn't been damaged. It's ideal for hail damage, door dings, minor creases, and dents from shopping carts or balls. The success of PDR depends on the dent's location, size, and depth. Generally, if a dent is smaller than a dinner plate and hasn't stretched the metal too severely, PDR can likely fix it.</p>

                            <div class="faq-content">
                                <p>The time required for PDR depends on the dent's severity and location. Simple door dings might take 30-60 minutes, while more complex dents or multiple dents (like hail damage) could take several hours. Most repairs can be completed the same day, which is much faster than traditional body shop repairs that often take days or weeks.</p>

                                <p>No, PDR doesn't affect your vehicle's paint or finish. It preserves the original factory paint, which helps maintain your vehicle's value. There's no risk of paint mismatching, overspray, or other issues that can occur with traditional body repair. This is one of the biggest advantages of PDR.</p>

                                <p>Yes, most insurance policies cover PDR repairs, especially for hail damage or if another person caused the damage. PDR is generally preferred by insurance companies because it costs less than traditional repairs. Depending on your deductible, you may have little to no out-of-pocket expense. We can help you work with your insurance company to file a claim.</p>

                                    <li>Assessment: The technician examines the dent to determine if PDR is suitable.</li>
                                    <li>Access: The technician gains access to the backside of the dent, often by removing interior panels or trimming.</li>
                                    <li>Visualization: Special lighting helps the technician see the dent from all angles.</li>
                                    <li>Repair: Using specialized tools, the technician carefully massages the metal back into its original position from behind.</li>
                                    <li>Quality check: The repair is inspected to ensure it meets professional standards.</li>

                                <p>Yes, PDR is the preferred method for repairing hail damage. It's particularly effective for the multiple small dents that hailstorms typically cause. PDR can restore your vehicle to its pre-storm condition without affecting the original paint. For extensive hail damage, the process may take longer, but it's still usually faster and less expensive than traditional body shop repairs.</p>
