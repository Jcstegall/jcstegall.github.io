            <li>Evaluation:
                <ol>
                    <li>Submission leads right to the page to be reviewed(primary page)</li>
                    <li>Some images in the images folder have capitals, but that is it.</li>
                    <li>Design
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fonts are nice, accumulus gave some contrast errors from the lighter pink text with the white background, but it isnt bad to the eye

                            </li>
                            <li>Unique site colors and fonts using standard .css files

                            </li>
                            <li>CRAP
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Accumulus shows some contrast errors with the lighter pink text on the white background, butit  is isnt too bad to the eye</li>
                                    <li>Great repetition, every page is similar format to allow for effortless browsing

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Everything is aligned, and the page is laid out well

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Great proximity. Page is not crowded and isn't too empty. Very good use of white space while not making too much.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Header Has site/brand header with text in an h1

                    <li>The header is h1 for brand/company name, but the index also has h1 for welcome, which should be h2 like the other pages have
