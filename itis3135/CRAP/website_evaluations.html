            <h3><a href="https://www.007museum.com/">James Bond 007 Museum</a></h3>
            <p>This horrid website is a showcasing of the James Bond Museum website. 
                The very long home page has a section with a border showcasing each 
                individual item at the museum and other videos and information. 
                If you are brave enough to click on one of the links, it will bring 
                you to a page with more details about the item.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast:The page has contrast due to its solely black 
                    and white nature, but it looks more like a government website from 
                    the 2000s than a website for a museum.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The repetition is poor. The only consistency is the lack of styling, 
                    causing the same default fonts, borders, and black text.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Zooming out on the webpage reveals design inconsistencies. 
                    Some boxes are centered while their content is not, while others are aligned randomly.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Proximity is a strong suit as almost every piece of media has 
                    a description and a link to further explore.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://whitewater.org/">White Water Center</a></h3>
            <p>This is a beautiful website that I actually analyzed last semester 
                for Human-Centered Design. The Whitewater Centerâ€™s website has great visual 
                cues and natural organization. This site effectively showcases 
                the center's attractions and events.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast:The contrast is excellent. While some text overlaps with images, 
                    the fonts and colors remain easy to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition:The website maintains a consistent style and layout across pages, 
                    making navigation intuitive. Grid-based organization enhances readability.</li>
                <li>Alignment:Alignment is executed professionally, eliminating visual clutter 
                    and ensuring a clean layout.</li>
                <li> Proximity:The website effectively groups related elements. Main sections 
                    feature background images with text overlays, making navigation intuitive.</li>
            </ul>
